# chrome-currency-translate

[Supported currencies](src/core/currencies.ts)

## Why

I often try software from overseas products, and the monthly fee is almost always shown in foreign currency. However, there was no tool to easily convert the currency on the page, so it was a hassle every time I tried.
(Raycast is best, but still requires some steps.)

This extension was created with the aim of making it easy to convert, prioritizing convenience over accuracy. If you are like me and often use foreign-made software, this extension will be useful for you.
